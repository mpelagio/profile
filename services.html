      <h3>Web Design</h3>
      <p>
        Creation of websites and applications using web languages such as HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the
        site or app. When you visit your website, the design elements you see
        were created by a front-end developer. Web design also refers to the
        design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers
        to the user experience aspects of website development rather than
        software development. Web design used to be focused on designing
        websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for
        mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

        A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases,
        content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors,
        font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured
        and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically
        pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well
        both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In
        responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size;
        in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that
        match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as
        possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and
        engagement. As responsive design can present difficulties in this
        regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control of how their
        work will appear. If they are responsible for the content as well, while
        they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the
        advantage of full control of the finished product. Credit belongs to

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        Creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects
        such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database
        management. It is the creation of an application that works over the
        internet i.e. websites. Web development also refers in general to the
        tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or
        internet. The web development process includes web design, web content
        development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security
        configuration, among other tasks. <br />
        <br />
        In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions,
        updates, and operations required to build, maintain and manage a website
        to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are optimal.

        It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic actions
        needed to ensure its proper ranking on search engine results. Usually,
        those tasks pertain to a different specialization, namely search engine
        optimization (SEO) Web development is also known as website development,
        while the professionals that maintain a website are called web
        developers or (more commonly) web devs. Credit belongs to

    <div id="App Design" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>App Design</h3>
      <p>
        The task of designing mobile applications. Even though mobile apps have
        a wide variety of uses, what unifies them is the need for optimal
        usability, accessibility, engagement, and overall user experience. In
        short, addressing all the above concerns. App design also combines the
        user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). While UI lends itself to
        the overall style of the app (including the colors, fonts, and general
        look and feel), UX focuses on the actual functionality and usability.
        <br /><br />
        A large number of users abandon an app after using it for the first
        time. Since users are picky about which apps they use and so quick to
        abandon those they don’t enjoy, it’s essential to invest time and effort
        in creating a great user experience. The better the design, the better
        the chance that a user will engage with it and thus keep using it.
        <br /><br />
        Just like any other product or service, apps need to be designed,
        organized, and strategized to solve user problems. Before you begin the
        app design, it’s important to conduct market research to gain a better
        understanding of your users. What do users need? What problem are you
        solving for them? What value will you bring them? Your app’s success
        depends on knowing these answers. Great design is not only about great
        aesthetics; it’s also about matching user expectations. You need to
        ensure the information architecture of your app matches the user’s
        mental model, navigation patterns are self-evident, all touch targets
        (such as buttons) are finger-friendly, and the app content looks equally
        good on mobile devices as it does on the web at various screen sizes and
        resolutions.
